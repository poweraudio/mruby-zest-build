== Zyn-Fusion User Interface


Welcome to the source of the Zyn-Fusion user interface.

== Preparations

After cloning the repository, initialize the submodules:
[source,bash]
----
git submodule init
git submodule update
----

== Building on Linux

Zyn-Fusion depends on libuv and mesa (packages libuv1-dev, mesa-common-dev,
libgl1-mesa-dev on Debian variants).

To build you'll want to use the Makefile:
[source,bash]
----
make
----
and the ahead-of-time qml compiler 'rebuild-fcache.rb'.

=== Building on OS X

In order to make the build work on a recent OSX (at the time of writing, 10.13),
run the make process as follows:

[source,bash]
----
OS=Mac make osx
----
There will be a number of deprecation warnings, these can be ignored.

The main difference to the Linux build are the linking options (The process links against
the `OpenGL` and the `AppKit` frameworks.

== Running

The build process will create a `libzest.so` library and the `zest` executable.
See the link:contributing.adoc[contributing.adoc] document for information about
running the application and changing it.

Enjoy,
